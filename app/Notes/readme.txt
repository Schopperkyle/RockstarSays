App Name: Rockstar Says

Description: Rockstar Says is an app with similar functionality to that of the classic game Simon Says.
             The game starts by playing music and highlighting randomly one out of four buttons on the
             screen; each button has a different color (red, blue, yellow and green). The user should
             then repeat which button the system highlights. After each correct answer by the user,
             the system will add an additional button to the sequence. The game will continue until
             the user selects the buttons in the wrong sequence, or until the user wins by reaching level 5.
             *** There is music, so beware of your computer volume before playing ***
